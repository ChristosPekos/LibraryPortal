<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>


For the program to work you need to have mysql and a python 3 version installed.



Once those are installed you need to go to the databaselib.py file and:


<p>3. database connection</p>


type your system's info (host user passwd ) inside the ''.


<p>4. database initialization</p>


Once you do that you need to comment out and run the #mycursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE librarydb") command.



Then in the mysql connector{} type: database = 'librarydb'.


<p>6. adding data to the database</p>


Next you need to remove the """ """ from each comment and run it. Now the database is good to go!




<h2>üöÄ How to Run</h2>


 <p>To run the program run the lib.py file.</p> 
 <p>Once you run the lib.py module you have 2 options: </p> 
 <p>1.You can choose to sign up and a new user will be created while his data will be stored in the database </p> 
 <p>2.You can choose to log in so here are some data of users already created: username = Takis123 password = 12345678.</p>  
 <p>Once you are logged in the program will guide you through with instructions. </p> 
 <p>In case you want to check how the program changes the database data copy and paste these in the lib.py module: </p> 

 ```
 mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM student") 
 myresult = mycursor.fetchall() 
 for row in myresult: print(row) 
 mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM book") 
 myresult = mycursor.fetchall() 
 for row in myresult: print(row) 
 mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM student_loans")
